<h1>What is Queue?</h1>
<p>Queue is an application that was developed by a few General Assembly's WDI Students: Anessa Arnold, Mike Christenson, Patrick Finazzo and Nancy Nguyen.
This application was created with the intention of testing and tracking a student's progress on topics taught in WDI. Queue is a study guide aide that helps the students pinpoint problem areas and understand levels of comprehension on any given tested area. Features include, but not limited to: allowing instructors to create and assign quizzes to students, allow users to sign in with their github account and view results as a student or instructor.</p>
